    <h1>Homework #1</h1>
    </center>
    <p>I didn't have a lot of coding experience at one point, basically I followed what the teacher said. I learned html and css and although I had the basic elements and knowledge it was hard to create my own style. My coding skills were poor and I had to rely a lot on plucking elements from the internet to put together my own website. I've also learned some Java Script, but I don't know how it works, and coding in JS on my own is almost impossible for me.</p>
    <p>I participated in Interaction Core 1 last semester, learning Html, Css, and JS. There are also some self-study sites like W3 School and some Youtube videos.</p>
    <p>When I first started learning coding last semester I felt very lost because what the professor was teaching in class didn't match up with the assignments that were left. Even if I listened to the class very carefully, I would still struggle with the assignments. After learning a few things on my own I realized that I couldn't find my own style, the page layout was inaccurate, and the information didn't stand out enough. Then in class I stumbled upon an artist's design websites that resonated with my general style, which were shared by my classmates during class. I started browsing tons of other people's websites to learn why they laid it out the way they did and how they coded. </p>
    <p>What confuses me the most is the use of JS, it's not as structured as Css, and I often don't understand or utilize it, I don't know where the concepts are. There are a lot of JS areas that we didn't cover in last year's class. </p>
    <p>I'm very excited and looking forward in learning about code, I'm curious a lot about how to make animations with JS and setting up styles in CSS. I'm a little anxious about if I can code out the ideas in my mind, because I'm still on the first stage of learning code and fear about the outcome will not be what I thought of. </p>
    <p>I think it will be super helpful once you learn code, because it can unlock elements that can't be accomplished on paper. With the combination of digital, hand-drawing or design, and typogaphy skills, I can get more career opportunity and showing out the ideas in my mind better. </p>
    <p>The text editor I perfer to use is Vistual Studio Code.</p>
    <p>Yes, I have used Github before.</p>
    <p1>To understand the difference and the role of HTML, CSS, and JS played in web development, you can think of creating an hamburger: </p1>
    <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The bun and and basic ingredients. Imagine HTML, as the bun of a hamburger and the essential components like the patty, lettuce and tomato as its ingredients. Similar to how these elements come to create the foundation of a hamburger HTML serves as the foundation of a web page. It provides organization and coherence by defining the placement of elements such as headers, footers, images and text. Just like how the bun holds together the patty and veggies, in a burger. </li>
    <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): The Seasonings and Presentation. CSS is like the spices, condiments and presentation of a hamburger. It's what gives the hamburger its appeal and deliciousness. Similarly CSS brings style to web pages by controlling the arrangement, colors, fonts and spacing. Like how cheese, ketchup, mustard and a toasted bun elevate the appearance and flavor of a hamburger.</li>
    <li>Java Script (The Functionality and Interactivity): JavaScript can be compared to the components of your house such, as systems, plumbing and various gadgets. Its primary function is to enable all the elements that we rely on like lights that can be turned on or off the heating system, the television and even smart home devices. In the context of a website JavaScript plays a role in facilitating interactions such, as form submissions, interactive maps, animated graphics and any element that updates on the screen without requiring a page reload.</li>
